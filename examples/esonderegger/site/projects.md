Here are some things that I'm working on or have worked on:

Code
----

### [JAGSS - Just Another Generator for Static Sites](http://jagss.rpy.xyz)
JAGSS is a command line tool for generating static web sites. It is built using [python](https://www.python.org/), [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [yaml](http://www.yaml.org/), [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/), [less](http://lesscss.org/), and [sass](http://sass-lang.com/). I use it for creating this site and several others.

### [Movie, Presto!](http://www.moviepresto.com)
This site aims to be an elegant front end to the movie metadata at [themoviedb.org](http://www.themoviedb.org/).
It attempts to find matching entries in the iTunes, Amazon instant, and Nexflix catalogs and provide
links directly to the desired content. It is built using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and is hosted on
[App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/).

### [Modal Photo Gallery for Bootstrap/Jekyll](https://gist.github.com/2334002)
I put this together because I was frustrated with the state of image galleries available for
Twitter Bootstrap. I was using Jekyll, Bootstrap 2, and Github pages to host this site back then. I don't use this for my photo galleries any more, but I've [left the demo up for posterity.](/photography.html)

Working with the Jekyll posts system added a little bit of complexity. I
decided to make each photo its own post and create a python script that auto-generates the html files
that live in the posts directory.

### [Minesweeper in Javascript/jquery](/minesweeper.html)
I built this in response to [Thumbtack's programming challenges](http://www.thumbtack.com/challenges), but had
a lot of fun with it, so decided to go a little overboard. The wonky UI (validate and cheat buttons) is a result
of the specifications they give. It definitely made me appreciate how elegant Microsoft's original design was.
When I'm done applying at Thumbtack, I may give it the more conventional buttons.

Music

### [Off Bass Brass: Knock Yourself Out](http://www.amazon.com/Knock-Yourself-Out-Bass-Brass/dp/B003H29SGU)
Off Bass Brass is a tuba/euphonium quartet consisting of Ryan McGeorge and  Mark Jenkins on euphonium
and John Cradler and Tom Holtz on Tuba. They Recorded "Knock Yourself Out" at the Landon School for Boys in early 2009
with me as their engineer. The CD was released on the [Potenza Music](http://www.potenzamusic.com/) label later that year.

Web

### [This Site](/)
This site is built using my static site generator, [JAGSS](https://github.com/esonderegger/jagss) and is hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).
It relies heavily on the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework. Posts and pages are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and templates are written in [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org).

### [Service Robotics & Technologies](http://srtlabs.com/)
I built this site for my startup using JAGSS and Bootstrap. It is hosted on [Amazon S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html).

### [Teiber Trio](http://teibertrio.com/)
The Teiber Trio conists of Regino Madrid (violin), Derek Smith (viola), and Charlie Powers (cello).
I built this site in 2009 using [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org), knowing I would not be involved in 
the site's maintenance. I also took the photos featured on the site.
